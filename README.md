TL;DR; A C# Application to install ACT, and multiple plugins, for Final Fantasy XIV.

### Why another Actor? Do we really need this?
To start, I did this *rework* for the Actor, just to make it accessible to everyone;

The real intent was, infact, to just translate the original Actor so that everyone could understand what was going on.
I ended up with this because I saw too many limitations in the original Actor; like the fact that it would install ACT exactly where you runned the script or the fact that I had to install all the plugins... even the ones I didn't wanted to!

So, to be completely honest, no you don't need this. 

You can install ACT manually, download all the things you need and do all the work on your own; I'm happy with that :)
I'll, anyway, use this little app, as it is simple and quick!

## Todo
Before we get to the juicy and ready-to-go ActorConsole, here are some of the goals I would like to achieve:
- Create the ActorGui (a more user-friendly interface for the Actor)

And everything that comes up to my mind while I code.
I'm also open to suggestions, so feel free to write me if you have an idea that may fit in the project ;)

This is the *console* version of the application. 
__This is a x64 architecture application, starting from version 1.9.2!__

The main goal was to have the program ready as soon as possible and then create a common library to use also for a future GUI version.
You can see the flow of how it came as it is now just by watching at the commits.

It is possible to run this console application with some arguments from command line:
- **/path="path where you want to install act"**
- **/y** and **/n**, which are mutually exclusive and respectively force to answer always yes (or no) to all questions in the app.

This app will download all the necessary file you need to use ACT without problems.
- At the start the app will prompt the user to know if the path where ACT will be installed is the right one
- After that the user will be asked if he needs to install the prerequisites (highly suggested, as this works also as a version check!):
  - Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable
  - Microsoft .NET Framework 4.7
  - Win10Pcap
- At this point the main applicaiton, ACT, will be downloaded (portable version) and installed in the path given at the start
- Then, for every plugin (exception made for the **FFXIV Parsing Plugin** wich is required), the app will prompt the user for:
  - Install the plugin (Yes is the default answer)
  - Overwrite the plugin configuration, if an old configuration file for the plugin is found (a backup will be made anyway)
- Will then clear the download folder
- And write the base configuration for ACT (will ask to Overwrite if there is already one)
- Before the start of the ACT the user may be prompted to add ACT to the Firewall Exceptions
- Yet again, before the start, the app will ensure that ACT will be run as administrator (and that doesn't use DPI Scaling)
- Finally will ask the user to run ACT

The plugins actually available are:
 - [FFXIV Parsing Plugin](https://github.com/ravahn/FFXIV_ACT_Plugin) (Required)
 - [Hojoring Plugin](https://github.com/anoyetta/ACT.Hojoring)
 - [Overlay Plugin](https://github.com/hibiyasleep/OverlayPlugin)
 - [DFAssist Plugin](https://github.com/easly1989/ffxiv_act_dfassist)
 - [Triggernometry](https://github.com/paissaheavyindustries/Triggernometry)

 ### Things already done
 - Better organize the output dir for compiled source
- Create a configuration file, versioned on github, with all the needed links (now hardcoded)
  - Handle the configuration and remove hardcoded strings
- Add Custom Triggers xml support
  - Check if can be imported from URL 
  - Version the xml files directly on github, when possible
  - Include Triggernometry plugin 
  - Add Hunts triggers
- Add Commandline parameter to skip all the iterations
  - **/path="installPath"** to specify a different install path when using commandline parameters
  - **/y** to silently install everything and run ACT in the end
  - **/n** to silently install only ACT and the FFXIV Parsing Plugin
  - Handle Commandline parameters in Actor.Core (to use them also with ActorGui)
- Load and Configure ACT before the first start (based on [this](https://gist.github.com/TomRichter/e044a3dff5c50024cf514ffb20a201a9))
  - Fast implementation for ActorConsole
  - Refactoring to use the same implementation for ActorGui
  - Handle configuration of kagerou overlay (it starts in japanese atm)
  - Add a plugin even if there is no configuration file (DFAssist may not need a configuration file)
- Edit the Advanced Combat Tracker.exe properties
  - Set to "Run as Administrator" to true
  - for Windows 10 (and 4k resolutions), Set "DPI override" to false
- Add ACT to the Windows Firewall exceptions (low priority)
- Ask to start ACT at the end of the installation
- Update an already existing ACT installation (now simply overwrites everything)
  - Check the versions and ask/download/install only the needed plugins/prerequisites
